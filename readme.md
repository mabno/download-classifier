# Download classifier

Simple program to polling files of download folder and classify them.
Written in Rust ðŸ¦€

## Usage

### Windows

```bash
./download-classifier.exe <path> <seconds>
```

`<path>` must be replaced by an absolute path of your downloads folder or whatever folder you want to classify.

`<seconds>` must be replaced by an number, what indicates the interval of polling (how often will be files classified)

Now, each 5 seconds the program will classify your files according to the configuration file called `classification.txt`.
You can modify this file to do you own classification criteria ðŸ˜Š
